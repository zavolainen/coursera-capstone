This is a capstone project repo for Coursera Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkings University. 

Project goal was to create a word prediction algorithm based on SwiftKey data and then distribute it as a Shiny Application.

Data is hosted by Coursera in [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip). 

The Shiny application can be found from [here](https://zavolainen.shinyapps.io/NextWordPredictionApp/).
